# Loan Predictor

## Objectives

There are numerous tutorials to build Machine Learning (ML) models for various purposes. However, most of them are focused on improving the models but not actually implementing those models in real life. In this project, I implement an ML model using the Scikit-Learn library for predicting whether the user is eligible for a house loan with some inputs including education information, marriage information, gender, income, etc. Then, I create a fully functional, production-ready REST API using that model, then provide a User Interface built with React.js to easily get the predicted output from the model.

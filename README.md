# Loan Predictor

## Objectives

There are numerous tutorials to build Machine Learning (ML) models for various purposes. However, most of them are focused on improving the models but not actually implementing those models in real life. In this project, I implement an ML model using the Scikit-Learn library for predicting loan costs and create a fully functional, production ready API using that model, then provide a User Interface to easily use the model.
